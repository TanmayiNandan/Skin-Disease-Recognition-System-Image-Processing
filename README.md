# Skin-Disease-Recognition-System-Image-Processing
This project is an endeavour to learn the concepts of image processing and to implement the basic techniques and lessons taught in the course into real world problems. The project basically tries to extract images from a huge dataset with constraints using MATLAB coding to find the desired result in minimal time. The project will be having a dataset from which the images will be extracted the patient is suffering from. The required image will be provided to the skin disease recognition system, there it will be trained i.e., the image will be converted into segments using segmentation and further it will be converted into vector which will then be compared to the vector image that is already present in the dataset. At last the image will be matched with the required image and the user will be able to find that the patient is suffering from which disease in very short amount of time. This technique can be used in real world situations which will help in providing better outcomes and save many lives.
